## Project Description

This To-Do List Application was built to practice creating an API using C# and ASP.NET Core, as well as connecting the API to a React frontend. The goal was to practice implementing and testing all CRUD operations to better understand their use in real-world applications.

## Technologies and Libraries

The project was built using the following technologies and libraries:

- C#
- React
- ASP.NET Core
- Selenium (for testing)
- xUnit (for testing)
- MySQL (for persistent data storage)

## Features

This is a simple application that helps users keep track of tasks and mark them as complete. It allows users to:

- Create tasks with a description
- View a list of tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Keep track of completed tasks
- Delete completed tasks

## Installation

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the web interface. To create a new task, click the input and fill out the form with the task description. You can view all your tasks on the main page. To update a task, click directly on the text. To delete a task, click on the "X" to the right of the task description. To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox next to the task.
